# Basic Digital Rights Management

## Project Description

The Basic Digital Rights Management (DRM) system is a blockchain-based solution built on Ethereum that enables content creators to register their digital assets and manage licensing rights in a decentralized manner. This smart contract system provides a transparent, immutable, and automated way to handle digital content licensing, ensuring proper attribution and compensation for content creators while providing verifiable access rights to licensees.

The system allows content owners to register their digital works (documents, images, videos, music, etc.) with specified licensing terms and pricing. Users can then purchase time-bound licenses to access and use the content legally, with all transactions recorded on the blockchain for transparency and dispute resolution.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a decentralized ecosystem where digital content creators have full control over their intellectual property rights while providing a seamless and trustless licensing mechanism. We aim to eliminate intermediaries, reduce licensing costs, and create a fair marketplace where creators are properly compensated for their work.

By leveraging blockchain technology, we envision a future where:
- Content creators maintain complete ownership and control of their digital assets
- Licensing transactions are transparent and immutable
- Users can easily verify legitimate access to digital content
- Disputes are minimized through clear, programmatic licensing terms
- Global accessibility without geographical restrictions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Hardhat or Truffle for development
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Compile contracts: `npx hardhat compile`
4. Deploy to testnet: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli`
5. Verify contract on Etherscan (optional)

### Usage
1. **Register Content**: Call `registerContent()` with title, content hash, price, and license limit
2. **Purchase License**: Use `purchaseLicense()` with content ID and payment
3. **Verify Access**: Check license validity with `verifyLicense()`

## Contract Architecture

The main contract includes three core functions:
- `registerContent()`: Register new digital content for licensing
- `purchaseLicense()`: Purchase time-bound licenses for content
- `verifyLicense()`: Verify if a user has valid access to content
